excerpt: Maybe you are late for a deadline, are frustrated someone else did not fulfill what they said they would, or weeks of planning just didn't work out this time. Regardless, we can choose how we will handle our emotions to be a positive force in our daily activities.

At my Alma-mater, students were  told they'd need to complete the remainder of their Spring semester online. In a matter of days Storm Lake's BVU morphed from a engaged and communal hub for education to a mostly deserted campus with many students left asking, where to go from here?

Thankfully, the school made the correct choice, as the University township, Storm Lake, would become one of the most concentrated areas in the US for COVID-19 exposure. 

Many from the community were left asking,
>
Am I sick?
>
Is a person close to me sick?
>
Will I give it to somebody at high risk?
>

The bright side to this all is it can provide insight on how anxiety, panic, and fear all play an integral role on our attitude. Naturally, anything that threatens you or a loved ones survival will emit an emotional response, and that is okay!

Acknowledging our own fear as a result of COVID-19 can help us act more rationally with our actions. This power comes from analyzing our own feelings, and just because you notice these emotional forces in others, does not mean you will necessarily react better when you're in the same scenario.

As emotional creatures, it becomes very exhausting to try and *control* your emotions; rather, we should focus on how we can react to our inner-emotions by abstracting our feelings. This helps us psychologically distance ourselves and respond effectively regardless of how emotionally invested we are in a situation.

The future of the current epidemic remains to be seen. However, these anxieties we are experiencing are not new. Instead they are only more observable because this is more generalized stress effecting a greater population making these feelings more observable. Yet we have always experienced the same types of stresses occurring today, we often just ignore the signs.

Maybe you are late for a deadline, are frustrated someone else did not fulfill what they said they would, or weeks of planning just didn't work out this time. Regardless, we can choose how we will handle our emotions to be a positive force in our daily activities.

      if 'stress' in scenario:
        scenario.replace('stress', 'insight and curiosity')

To summarize, recognizing our own emotions as a powerful force that we are willing to look at from a bigger picture can help us become better peers, and sometimes even motivate us to create even greater works. This doesn't mean you should never have a reaction to your emotions, only that you can recognize and adapt to our own emotional impulses and respond accordingly.
